**Overview**

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict the prices of cars based on various features such as make, model, mileage, year, and more. The notebook covers:

Data cleaning and exploration
Feature engineering
Model building and tuning
Model evaluation

**Installation**

To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you will need to install the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project contains various features of cars, such as:

Make: The manufacturer of the car.
Model: The model of the car.
Year: The year the car was manufactured.
Mileage: The total distance the car has traveled.
Engine Size: The size of the car's engine.
Fuel Type: The type of fuel the car uses.
Price: The target variable representing the car's price.

**Modeling**

The notebook demonstrates several steps in the machine learning pipeline:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for modeling.
Model Selection: Trying different machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).
Model Training: Training the model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

**Results**

The best-performing model in this notebook is [Model Name] with the following metrics:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): X
R-squared Score: Y
